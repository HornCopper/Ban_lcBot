# Ban_lcBot
A automatic application to find the bot called "蓉蓉" from your bot (Just for OneBot V11)

# Usage

Say `Serfend Didn't Follow AGPLv3`. Then see the steps below.

Run the `checksb.py` after edit the file.

```python3
bots = ["40001", "40002", "40003", "40004", "40005"]

groups = {}

group_members = {}

prefix = "http://192.168.3.18:{port}/{action}"
```

`bots` is the ports of your onebot.

`prefix` is the domain or IP address of your onebot.

Just edit they two. Keep other configurations.

Finally, run it! And you will find a JSON in the same directory. Open it with a single editor. Press `Ctrl+F` to search `蓉蓉`.

`Visual Studios Code` is the most recommended editor!
